---

## Strategic Context

### What We've Validated

**Competitive Research** (4 analyses):
- ✅ Tauric Research - Memory + reflection validated
- ✅ ai-hedge-fund - Scenario DCF, backtesting, insider data evaluated
- ✅ LangGraph - Selective adoption (resilience patterns)
- ✅ OpenAI Swarm - Stateful architecture confirmed

**Strategic Validations**:
- ✅ Custom approach necessary (ChatGPT can't do deterministic math)
- ✅ Gaps are fundamental (better models won't close them)
- ✅ DBOT benchmark: 76/100 (C+ vs our 90/100 target)
- ✅ Data sources: SEC EDGAR + Yahoo + Brave (skip paid alternatives)

**See**: `docs/competitive_analysis/STRATEGIC_PLANNING_SYNTHESIS.md` for complete wrap-up

### Current System Architecture

**5 Core Agents** (Production-ready):
1. HypothesisGenerator (Sonnet) - Generate testable investment theses
2. DeepResearchAgent (Haiku + Sonnet) - Evidence gathering with iterative deepening
3. DialecticalEngine (2×Sonnet) - Bull/bear synthesis at checkpoints
4. NarrativeBuilder (Sonnet) - Institutional-grade reports
5. PMEvaluator (Haiku) - Automatic A-F grading

**Valuation Engine**:
- Deterministic NumPy-based DCF (zero LLM in math)
- 100% mathematical accuracy
- Full audit trail

**Cost Performance**:
- $3.35 per analysis (89% optimized)
- Haiku for filtering, Sonnet for deep analysis
- Strategic synthesis (not exhaustive debates)

**See**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for complete architecture

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 0: Evaluation Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2) - **NEXT**

**Purpose**: Build evaluation harness BEFORE enhancements (RL curriculum insight from Tauric)

**Why This Matters**:
- Can't improve what we can't measure
- Need baseline to validate each enhancement
- Prevents overfitting to single examples

**Deliverables**:

1. **3-Tier Evaluation Corpus** (30 historical cases from 2020-2023)
   - Tier 1 (Easy): 10 stable companies (KO, JNJ, PG)
   - Tier 2 (Medium): 10 moderate complexity (AAPL, NVDA, TSLA)
   - Tier 3 (Hard): 10 high uncertainty (UBER, turnarounds, distressed)

2. **ChromaDB Memory System**
   - Collection 1: `analysis_memory` (store every analysis + outcomes)
   - Collection 2: `personal_knowledge` (import Notion notes)
   - Collection 3: `trusted_sources` (SemiAnalysis, Damodaran blog)

3. **Baseline Metrics**
   - Run current agent (58/100) on all 30 test cases
   - Track: PM evaluation score, prediction error, cost per analysis
   - Establish improvement targets

4. **Data Source Stack Finalized**
   - ✅ SEC EDGAR Direct API (fundamentals)
   - ✅ Yahoo Finance (real-time prices)
   - ✅ Brave Search MCP (web research)
   - ✅ Build SEC filing full-text parser (10-K MD&A)

**Success Criteria**:
- 30 test cases scored and tracked
- ChromaDB operational with 3 collections
- Baseline: Current agent performance documented
- Data sources: All integrations working

**Timeline**: 2 weeks
**See**: `docs/BACKTESTING_DESIGN.md`, `docs/MEMORY_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`

---

### Phase 1: Data Moat + Institutional Rigor (Months 1-3)

**Target**: 58 → 96/100 (A institutional quality) - **Exceeds 90 target!**

**Why Phase 1 Alone is Sufficient**:
- ai-hedge-fund analysis revealed: Memory + Backtesting + Scenarios = 93 points (exceeds 90)
- Phase 2 becomes optional enhancement, not critical path
- Focus on high-ROI improvements validated by competitive research

**Priority Enhancements**:

#### 1.1 Scenario DCF (Bear/Base/Bull) [+10 points]
**Why**: Institutional PMs demand probabilistic outcomes, not point estimates

**Implementation**:
- Extend ginzu.py to support 3 scenarios with probabilities
- Calculate expected value: E[V] = P_bear·V_bear + P_base·V_base + P_bull·V_bull
- Output: Expected total return vs current price
- Enhance NarrativeBuilder to present scenarios clearly

**Effort**: 1 week (valuation schema + narrative integration)

#### 1.2 Backtesting Framework (Frozen Fundamentals) [+10 points]
**Why**: Track prediction accuracy, identify systematic errors, build credibility

**Implementation**:
- Disable web search/news during backtesting (data leakage prevention)
- Use time-stamped SEC filings only (known as of analysis date)
- Run agent on 30 historical cases (2020-2023)
- Generate benchmark report (agent vs SPY vs sector ETF)
- Track outcomes at 6mo, 1yr, 3yr intervals

**Effort**: 2 weeks (new orchestrator mode + reporting)

#### 1.3 Enhanced Research Sources (Trusted Source Scraper) [+5 points]
**Why**: Access expert insights (SemiAnalysis, Damodaran) to augment hypothesis generation

**Implementation**:
- Build TrustedSourceScraperAgent
- RSS/YouTube integration for expert content
- Daily scraping → ChromaDB `trusted_sources` collection
- Sources: SemiAnalysis (Dylan Patel), Damodaran blog, curated expert list

**Effort**: 1.5 weeks (new agent + ChromaDB integration)

#### 1.4 Memory-Enhanced Hypothesis Generation [+8 points]
**Why**: "I've seen this before" reasoning, avoid redundant research, leverage prior insights

**Implementation**:
- Query ChromaDB (all 3 collections) before generating hypotheses
- Surface: Past analysis patterns, personal notes, expert commentary
- Attribute insights to sources in narrative ("Per SemiAnalysis analysis...")
- Avoid re-researching known information

**Effort**: 1 week (HypothesisGenerator enhancement + prompt engineering)

#### 1.5 Institutional Report Features [+5 points]
**Why**: DBOT (76/100) lacks actionable recommendations - we fill this gap

**Implementation**:
- Explicit recommendation (BUY/HOLD/SELL with price targets)
- Entry/exit bands (Buy <$X, Trim >$Y, Exit if...)
- Thesis statement (one paragraph, falsifiable)
- Risk quantification (dollar impact + probability, not just qualitative)

**Effort**: 1 week (NarrativeBuilder + HTML template)

**Total Phase 1**: +38 points → **96/100 (A)** exceeds 90 target!

**Timeline**: 10-12 weeks
**Success Criteria**: A- (90/100) or better on 80%+ of 30 test cases

**See**: `docs/VALUATION_AI_FRONTIER.md` Sections V-VI for detailed design

---

### Phase 2: Behavioral Edge (Months 4-6) - **OPTIONAL**

**Trigger**: Only if Phase 1 testing reveals systematic gaps

**Why Optional**: Phase 1 already achieves 96/100 (exceeds 90 target). Phase 2 adds behavioral intelligence for edge cases.

**Potential Enhancements** (if needed):

#### 2.1 ContrarianAgent (Memory-Enhanced)
**Purpose**: Challenge consensus, identify crowded trades, contrarian opportunities

**Implementation**:
- Query market sentiment (VIX, put/call ratio, short interest)
- Compare to historical patterns (memory lookup)
- Flag: "Market is extremely bullish, consider downside risks"
- **Impact**: +3 points (behavioral intelligence)

#### 2.2 SentimentAnalysisAgent (Pattern-Aware)
**Purpose**: Track sentiment shifts, identify inflection points

**Implementation**:
- Aggregate news sentiment (positive/negative coverage)
- Social media signals (Twitter, Reddit mentions)
- Insider buying/selling patterns
- **Impact**: +2 points (timing signals)

#### 2.3 MetaReasoningAgent (Self-Awareness)
**Purpose**: "Know what you don't know" - circle of competence

**Implementation**:
- Confidence calibration (estimate confidence vs evidence strength)
- Uncertainty quantification (best/base/worst with probabilities)
- Circle of competence assessment (flag unfamiliar domains)
- **Impact**: +2 points (humility + transparency)

**Total Phase 2**: +7 points → **103/100** (capped at 100, A+ institutional)

**Timeline**: 6 weeks (if needed)
**Decision Point**: After Phase 1 validation, assess if systematic gaps exist

**See**: `docs/VALUATION_AI_FRONTIER.md` Section V.2 for detailed specs

---

### Phase 3: Learning Systems (Months 7-12) - **LONG-TERM MOAT**

**Purpose**: Create compounding advantage over time (network effects)

**Why It Matters**:
- Year 1: 50 analyses, limited patterns
- Year 3: 500 analyses, strong patterns
- Year 5: 2000 analyses, Damodaran-level pattern recognition

**Enhancements**:

#### 3.1 Analysis Memory Database [+4 points]
**Purpose**: Track outcomes, learn from mistakes, pattern recognition

**Implementation**:
- Store every analysis with outcomes (3mo, 6mo, 1yr, 3yr)
- Similarity search: "Find companies like NVDA in 2020"
- Reflection mechanism: "What did I get wrong? Why?"
- Pattern extraction: "High-growth tech companies with margin compression..."

**Effort**: 4 weeks (infrastructure heavy)

#### 3.2 Automated A/B Testing [+2 points]
**Purpose**: Continuously improve prompts, workflows, agent design

**Implementation**:
- Test variations on held-out dataset
- Track: PM score, prediction accuracy, cost
- Auto-deploy winning variants
- Cumulative improvement over time

**Effort**: 2 weeks

#### 3.3 Feedback Loop Integration [+2 points]
**Purpose**: Update beliefs based on actual outcomes

**Implementation**:
- Track: Hypothesis validation (which predictions came true?)
- Update confidence: "I was too bullish on data center demand in 2020..."
- Adjust priors: "Margin compression is rarer than I thought..."

**Effort**: 2 weeks

**Total Phase 3**: +8 points (cumulative) → **Network effects business**

**Timeline**: 6 months
**Compounding Effect**: Gets better with every analysis

**See**: `docs/VALUATION_AI_FRONTIER.md` Section V.3 for detailed specs

## Decision Framework

### When to Proceed to Next Phase

**Phase 0 → Phase 1**:
- ✅ 30 test cases scored
- ✅ ChromaDB operational
- ✅ Baseline established
- **Decision**: Automatic proceed

**Phase 1 → Phase 2**:
- ✅ If Phase 1 achieves 90/100: **STOP** (target met)
- ⚠️ If Phase 1 only achieves 75-89/100: **Proceed to Phase 2**
- ❌ If Phase 1 <75/100: **Debug, don't add complexity**

**Phase 2 → Phase 3**:
- ✅ If 50+ analyses completed: **Proceed** (enough data for learning)
- ⚠️ If <50 analyses: **Wait** (insufficient pattern data)

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Phase 1 doesn't reach 90/100 | Low | Conservative estimates, backtesting validates |
| Backtesting reveals fundamental flaws | Medium | This is WHY we do Phase 0 first |
| ChromaDB scaling issues | Low | Proven tech, we're only storing ~100 analyses/year |
| Cost overruns | Low | Tight monitoring, Haiku/Sonnet tiering |
