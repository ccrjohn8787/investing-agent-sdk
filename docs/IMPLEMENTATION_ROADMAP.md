## Risk Mitigation

### High Risks

**Risk 1**: Agent quality below expectations
- **Mitigation**: Test early and iterate on prompts
- **Contingency**: Use higher-tier models if needed

**Risk 2**: Cost exceeds budget
- **Mitigation**: Implement optimizations early
- **Contingency**: Adaptive degradation system

**Risk 3**: Integration issues between agents
- **Mitigation**: Test agent interfaces early
- **Contingency**: Build adapters for mismatches

**Risk 4**: Context management fails at scale
- **Mitigation**: Test with long iterations
- **Contingency**: More aggressive compression

### Medium Risks

**Risk 5**: Claude API rate limits hit
- **Mitigation**: Implement backoff and retry
- **Contingency**: Queue system for calls

**Risk 6**: Evidence quality poor
- **Mitigation**: Test filtering thresholds
- **Contingency**: Manual evidence curation

**Risk 7**: Debugging difficulty
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive logging from start
- **Contingency**: Add more detailed traces

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Claude API access (required)
- SEC EDGAR API access (public, no key needed)
- Python 3.10+ environment

### Internal Dependencies
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 (foundation)
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 2 (agents)
- Phase 4 depends on Phase 3 (integration)

### Critical Path
```
Phase 1 (Foundation) → Phase 2 (Agents) → Phase 3 (Integration) → Launch
```

Phases 4-5 can partially overlap with Phase 3.
