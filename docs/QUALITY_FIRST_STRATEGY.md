# Quality-First Strategy

## Executive Summary

**NEW PHILOSOPHY**: With Claude Max subscription covering costs, we optimize for **QUALITY and DEPTH** over cost savings.

**Previous approach**: 89% cost reduction through strategic synthesis, model tiering, context pruning
**New approach**: Maximize analytical depth, thoroughness, and insight quality

**Key Insight**: Claude Max removes the cost constraint. We should produce the **best possible** institutional-grade research, not the **cheapest acceptable** research.

## Paradigm Shift

### Old Philosophy (Cost-Constrained)
```
❌ Use Haiku where possible (cheaper)
❌ Strategic synthesis only at checkpoints (fewer calls)
❌ Filter-then-analyze to reduce tokens
❌ Context pruning to stay under limits
❌ Early stopping to minimize iterations
```

### New Philosophy (Quality-First)
```
✅ Use Sonnet for all analytical tasks (better reasoning)
✅ Thorough dialectical analysis throughout (deeper insights)
✅ Full context analysis without filtering (miss nothing)
✅ Generous context windows (full information)
✅ Run until confidence threshold met naturally (no artificial limits)
```

## Revised Model Selection

### Principle: Choose Best Model for Each Task

| Agent | Old Model | New Model | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **HypothesisGenerator** | Sonnet | **Sonnet** | ✅ Creative synthesis requires best reasoning |
| **DeepResearch (Filter)** | Haiku | **Sonnet** | ⬆️ Better relevance detection, miss fewer insights |
| **DeepResearch (Analysis)** | Sonnet | **Sonnet** | ✅ Keep best for deep analysis |
| **DialecticalEngine** | Sonnet | **Sonnet** | ✅ Sophisticated argumentation critical |
| **NarrativeBuilder** | Sonnet | **Sonnet** | ✅ Professional writing quality matters |
| **Evaluator** | Haiku | **Sonnet** | ⬆️ Better quality assessment, nuanced scoring |

**Result**: Use **Sonnet everywhere** for maximum quality.

## Revised Analysis Depth

### Dialectical Analysis

**Old approach**: Strategic synthesis at checkpoints only (iterations 3, 6, 9, 12)
- 48 total dialectical calls
- Focus on top 2 hypotheses
- Single comprehensive bull/bear per checkpoint

**New approach**: Thorough dialectical analysis
- Synthesis at **every 2-3 iterations** (more frequent)
- Analyze **top 3-4 hypotheses** (not just 2)
- **Multiple rounds** of bull/bear debate if conflicts remain
- **Deeper evidence examination** per hypothesis

**Expected impact**:
- 2-3x more dialectical calls (~100-150 vs 48)
- Much deeper analytical insights
- Better contradictions surfaced
- Higher quality final conclusions

### Research Depth

**Old approach**: Filter-then-analyze
- Haiku filters to top 20% of sources
- Only analyze filtered sources with Sonnet
- Save 60-80% of calls

**New approach**: Comprehensive analysis
- **No filtering** - analyze all relevant sources
- Sonnet for all analysis (better judgment)
- Cross-reference sources more thoroughly
- Follow up on contradictions aggressively

**Expected impact**:
- 3-4x more research calls (~150-200 vs 36)
- Miss fewer important insights
- Better source triangulation
- Higher evidence quality

### Iteration Depth

**Old approach**:
- min_iterations: 10
- max_iterations: 15
- Early stopping at confidence >= 0.85

**New approach**:
- min_iterations: 12
- max_iterations: 25
- Early stopping at confidence >= 0.90 (higher bar)
- No artificial caps - run until truly confident

**Expected impact**:
- Longer analysis cycles (15-20 iterations typical vs 10-12)
- More refined hypotheses
- Better confidence in conclusions

## Updated Cost Model

### With Claude Max Subscription

**Reality**:
- Covered by subscription (no per-token charges)
- Usage counts toward daily quota
- Rate limits apply

**New Cost Model**:
```
Old approach:
  ~109 LLM calls per analysis
  ~$3.35 per analysis (if paying per token)

New approach:
  ~400-500 LLM calls per analysis
  Still $0 extra (covered by Claude Max)
  Uses more of daily quota
```

**Trade-off**:
- More quota usage per analysis
- Significantly higher quality output
- Worth it for institutional-grade research

### Usage Management

**Monitor**:
- Daily quota consumption
- Rate limit hits
- Time per analysis

**If hitting limits**:
- Run fewer analyses per day (prioritize quality over quantity)
- Stagger analysis runs
- Consider API key for production (pay per token, no limits)

## Rationale: Why Quality-First Makes Sense

### 1. Claude Max Coverage
- No incremental cost per call
- Only constraint is daily quota (generous)
- Much better ROI per analysis

### 2. Institutional-Grade Output
- Competing with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley research
- They spend 40+ hours per report
- We should match their depth/quality

### 3. Trust and Reliability
- Better quality → higher user confidence
- More thorough → fewer missed insights
- Deeper analysis → better investment decisions

### 4. Differentiation
- Many AI research tools cut corners to save costs
- We can differentiate with thoroughness
- "Most comprehensive AI research" positioning

### 5. Time vs Quality Trade-off
- Users care more about quality than speed
- 2-3 hours for excellent report >> 30 min for mediocre report
- Depth is the moat

---

## Monitoring and Adjustment

### Track These Metrics

**Usage**:
- LLM calls per analysis
- Time per analysis
- Quota consumption rate
- Rate limit incidents

**Quality**:
- EvaluatorAgent scores (target 0.85+)
- User feedback
- Evidence depth
- Hypothesis specificity

**Adjust If**:
- Hitting daily quotas consistently → slightly reduce depth
- Quality scores < 0.80 → increase depth further
- Time > 4 hours per analysis → optimize slowest agent
- User complaints about missing insights → increase thoroughness
