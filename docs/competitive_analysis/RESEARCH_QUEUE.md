## Completed Research

### âœ… 1. Tauric Research (Trading-R1 + TradingAgents)
**Date**: 2025-10-02 (Day 1)
**Document**: `2025-10-02_TauricResearch_Consolidated.md`
**Status**: Complete, integrated into VALUATION_AI_FRONTIER.md

**Key Takeaways**:
- Memory + Reflection works (+15 points validated)
- RL curriculum approach â†’ Build 3-tier evaluation harness FIRST (Phase 0)
- Multi-source behavioral data (sentiment, news, insider) addressable (+23 points)
- Anti-patterns confirmed: LLM math, shallow debates, no valuation anchor

**Strategic Impact**:
- Validated our memory architecture (3 collections design)
- Added Phase 0 to roadmap (evaluation harness before enhancements)
- Confirmed our core moats (deterministic DCF, deep iteration, institutional reports)

---

### âœ… 2. ai-hedge-fund
**Date**: 2025-10-02 (Day 2)
**Document**: `2025-10-02_AIHedgeFund.md`
**Status**: Complete, design documents created

**Key Takeaways**:
- Scenario DCF (bear/base/bull) - adopted (+10 points)
- Backtesting framework with benchmarks - design complete (+10 points)
- Insider data - deprioritized after critical review (+5 points, not +15)
- Investor personas - interesting but optional (+8 points)

**Strategic Impact**:
- Created BACKTESTING_DESIGN.md (9,000 words) - "Frozen Fundamentals" approach
- Created INSIDER_DATA_EVALUATION.md (7,000 words) - deprioritized to Tier 2
- Refined Phase 1: Memory + Backtesting + Scenarios = 58â†’93 (exceeds 90/100 target)

**Critical Decisions**:
1. Insider data downgraded from Tier 1 â†’ Tier 2 (trading signal, not long-term)
2. Backtesting will DISABLE web search/news (data leakage prevention)
3. Phase 1 alone is sufficient to reach 90+ (Phase 2 becomes optional)

---

### âœ… 3. LangGraph
**Date**: 2025-10-02 (Day 3)
**Document**: `2025-10-02_LangGraph.md`
**Status**: Complete, selective adoption strategy identified

**Key Takeaways**:
- Checkpoint persistence (SQLite/Postgres) - adopted (+5 points)
- Retry policies with exponential backoff - adopted (+3 points)
- Two-tier memory architecture - validates our ChromaDB plans (+8 points)
- Human-in-the-loop capabilities - high-value optional feature (+4 points)

**Strategic Impact**:
- Confirms our architectural advantages (deterministic DCF, specialized agents, cost optimization)
- Selective adoption strategy: Take their resilience patterns, keep our simpler orchestration
- Graph-based architecture is overkill for our linear analysis flow
- Projected impact from top 5 insights: +22 points

**What NOT to adopt**:
- Full graph architecture (too complex for our use case)
- Generic tool-calling (our specialized agents are better)
- Over-engineered state channels (our dict-based state works well)

---

### âœ… 4. OpenAI Swarm
**Date**: 2025-10-02 (Day 3)
**Document**: `2025-10-02_OpenAISwarm.md`
**Status**: Complete, **philosophical fork discovered**

**Key Takeaways**:
- Stateless architecture (radical simplicity, no memory)
- Return-based agent handoffs - elegant delegation (+3 points)
- Context variables pattern - clean state sharing (+2 points)
- Parallel tool execution - reduces latency (+2 points)

**Critical Discovery**: Philosophical Fork in Multi-Agent Space
- **Stateful** (Tauric, ai-hedge-fund, LangGraph): Memory, learning, persistence
- **Stateless** (Swarm): Simplicity, disposability, no learning

**Strategic Impact**:
- Breaks convergence pattern (3/4 favor stateful, 1/4 favor stateless)
- For long-term investment research: Stateful wins (learning compounds)
- For short-term tasks: Stateless may be simpler (not our use case)
- **Decision**: Continue research queue (need 6-7 total for confidence)

**What NOT to adopt**:
- Stateless architecture (would cripple learning capabilities)
- Over-simplified agents (our domain needs specialized tools)
- Generic tool execution (we need deterministic financial calculations)

## Early Termination Rationale

**Why Stop at 4/8 Analyses?**

After completing 4 competitive analyses + comprehensive strategic validation, we achieved sufficient confidence to proceed:

1. âœ… **Custom approach validated** - ChatGPT deep research comparison proves LLMs can't do deterministic math
2. âœ… **Gaps are fundamental** - Moat analysis proves better models (GPT-5, Claude 4) won't close gaps
3. âœ… **Stateful architecture wins** - 3/4 systems favor memory + learning for long-term research
4. âœ… **Academic benchmark established** - DBOT at 76/100 confirms institutional domain expertise required
5. âœ… **Phase 1 roadmap validated** - Memory + Backtesting + Scenarios = 58â†’96 points (exceeds 90 target)

**Remaining analyses (AutoGPT, Bloomberg GPT, AlphaResearch, Cognition AI) have diminishing returns:**
- AutoGPT: Medium value (memory patterns already covered by Tauric)
- Bloomberg GPT: Blocked (no terminal access)
- AlphaResearch: Low value (product strategy, not architecture)
- Cognition AI: Low value (coding agents, wrong use case)

**Decision**: Proceed to Phase 0 implementation (evaluation harness) with high confidence.

## Research Queue (Prioritized) - TERMINATED


### ðŸ”„ 5. AutoGPT/BabyAGI Autonomous Patterns [Medium Priority]
**Target System**: AutoGPT (or AgentGPT, BabyAGI)
**Primary URL**: https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT
**Estimated Timeline**: Week of Nov 4-11, 2025

**Research Focus**:
1. **Autonomous Goal Decomposition**: How do they break down complex goals?
2. **Self-Reflection**: Do they have reflection mechanisms like Tauric?
3. **Memory Systems**: Long-term vs short-term memory architecture
4. **Tool Use**: How do they decide which tools to use when?
5. **Failure Modes**: What breaks when agents are fully autonomous?

**Expected Insights**:
- Goal decomposition for hypothesis generation (+3 points)
- Self-reflection patterns (complement Tauric insights) (+2 points)
- Long-term memory design (+5 points)

**Why Medium Priority**: Autonomous agents are different from our structured approach, but memory/reflection patterns may be valuable.

---

### ðŸ”„ 6. Bloomberg GPT Financial LLMs [Medium Priority]
**Target System**: Bloomberg GPT (if accessible) or FinBERT alternatives
**Primary URL**: Bloomberg Terminal research, arXiv papers
**Estimated Timeline**: Week of Nov 18-25, 2025

**Research Focus**:
1. **Financial Domain Expertise**: How do domain-specific LLMs compare to general-purpose (Claude)?
2. **Training Data**: What financial corpora give them an edge?
3. **Financial NLP Tasks**: Sentiment analysis, entity extraction, event detection
4. **Comparison**: Bloomberg GPT vs Claude Sonnet for financial analysis
5. **ROI Analysis**: Is domain-specific LLM worth the cost vs prompt engineering?

**Expected Insights**:
- Whether we need financial-specific LLMs (+0-10 points, TBD)
- Financial NLP techniques we're missing (+5 points data)
- Training data sources we should add

**Why Medium Priority**: Expensive, potentially limited access. But if domain LLMs significantly outperform general LLMs, this changes our strategy.
