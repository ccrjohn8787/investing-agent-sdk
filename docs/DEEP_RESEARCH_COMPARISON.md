# Deep Research Approaches: Strategic Comparison

**Date**: 2025-10-02
**Question**: Should we build a custom investment research agent, or just use ChatGPT Deep Research / open-source deep research libraries?
**Status**: Critical Strategic Decision

---

## Executive Summary

**Bottom Line**: **Build custom**, but selectively adopt patterns from generic deep research.

**Why Custom Wins for Investment Research**:
1. **Deterministic valuation** (100% DCF accuracy) - impossible with generic LLM-based approaches
2. **Domain-specific data** (SEC EDGAR, insider patterns, DCF scenarios) - not in generic tools
3. **Institutional quality** (PM evaluation, evidence-backed claims, structured reports) - beyond generic capabilities
4. **Cost optimization** ($3.35 vs likely $50-100 for deep research) - critical at scale
5. **Specialized workflow** (10-15 iterations with dialectical synthesis) - tailored to investment analysis

**What We Should Steal from Deep Research**:
- Multi-source aggregation patterns
- Citation and source tracking
- Recursive exploration ("deep research" feature)
- Quality benchmarking frameworks

**Key Insight**: ChatGPT deep research produced a 32,000-word report on CRWV that is **impressive but fundamentally flawed for our use case** - no deterministic valuation, LLM-based math (hallucination risk), generic business analysis without investment-specific rigor.

## Part 1: Comparative Analysis

### 1.1 ChatGPT Deep Research

**What It Is**: OpenAI's o1-preview/GPT-4-powered research mode with extended thinking and multi-source web search.

**Strengths** (from CRWV analysis):
- ✅ **Comprehensive coverage**: 21 sections, 60+ sources, 32K words
- ✅ **Structured output**: Executive summary, thesis framing, scenarios, catalysts
- ✅ **Citation discipline**: Every claim sourced and dated
- ✅ **Multi-dimensional analysis**: Market, competitive, financial, operational, risk
- ✅ **Reasoning quality**: o1-preview's chain-of-thought produces sophisticated analysis
- ✅ **Speed**: Generated in ~30-60 minutes (estimated)
- ✅ **Quality gates**: 60-source threshold, coverage validator, quality scorecard

**Critical Weaknesses for Investment Research**:
1. ❌ **LLM-based math** (fatal flaw):
   ```
   CRWV report: "DCF yields mid value ~$130/share"
   Problem: No actual DCF shown, just LLM hallucinating a number
   Reality: Cannot verify calculation, cannot audit assumptions
   ```

2. ❌ **No deterministic valuation**:
   - Report mentions "DCF" but doesn't show ginzu.py-level NumPy calculations
   - Sensitivity tables are qualitative, not quantitative
   - Can't reproduce or audit the math

3. ❌ **Generic business framework**:
   - Porter's Five Forces, SWOT - not investment-specific
   - Missing: Scenario DCF, DCF bridge verification, PM evaluation

4. ❌ **No outcome tracking**:
   - One-shot analysis, no memory of past predictions
   - Can't learn "I was wrong about NVDA Q2 because..."

5. ❌ **Cost at scale**:
   - Estimated cost: $30-100 per analysis (o1-preview is expensive)
   - Our target: $3.35 per analysis (89% optimized)

**Example Quality Issues from CRWV Report**:
- "E[TR] ≈ +26%" - how was this calculated? Pure LLM inference, not math
- "WACC ~12%" - mentions components but no formula verification
- "Fair value band $100-$150" - based on what exact DCF inputs?

**When ChatGPT Deep Research Works Well**:
- Exploratory research (understanding a new industry)
- Qualitative analysis (competitive landscape, market trends)
- Quick high-level overviews (not decision-ready)

**When It Fails**:
- Investment decisions requiring math (DCF, sensitivity, scenarios)
- Institutional-grade research needing audit trails
- Anything requiring deterministic calculations

---

## Part 2: Critical Comparison Dimensions

### 2.1 Valuation Accuracy (MOST CRITICAL)

**Generic Deep Research (ChatGPT, open-source)**:
```python
# What they do (conceptual):
"Using DCF, I estimate fair value at $130/share"

Problem:
- How? What inputs?
- What WACC? What terminal growth?
- What revenue assumptions?
- Can you show me the math?

Answer: "Trust me, I'm an LLM" ❌
```

**Our Custom Agent**:
```python
# What we do (actual code from ginzu.py):
def dcf_valuation(inputs: InputsI) -> ValuationV:
    """Deterministic, auditable, reproducible"""
    revenue = compute_revenue_series(inputs.growth_rates)
    ebit = revenue * inputs.margins
    nopat = ebit * (1 - inputs.tax_rate)
    reinvestment = compute_reinvestment(revenue, inputs.sales_to_capital)
    fcff = nopat - reinvestment

    discount_factors = compute_discount_factors(inputs.wacc)
    pv_explicit = np.sum(fcff * discount_factors)

    terminal_value = compute_terminal_value(...)
    pv_terminal = terminal_value * discount_factors[-1]

    equity_value = pv_explicit + pv_terminal - net_debt + cash
    value_per_share = equity_value / shares

    return ValuationV(
        value_per_share=value_per_share,
        pv_bridge={'explicit': pv_explicit, 'terminal': pv_terminal},
        # ... full audit trail
    )
```

**Verdict**: For investment decisions, **deterministic > LLM-based math** (non-negotiable).

---

### 2.2 Research Depth & Iteration

**ChatGPT Deep Research**:
- Single-pass analysis (even with "deep research" mode)
- No iterative deepening or checkpoints
- Output is comprehensive but static

**GPT Researcher / Open Deep Research**:
- Recursive exploration ("deep research" feature)
- Multi-agent coordination (planner → executor)
- Still primarily single-pass with refinement

**Our Custom Agent**:
- **10-15 iterations** with strategic synthesis at checkpoints (3, 6, 9, 12)
- Each iteration refines hypotheses based on evidence
- Dialectical engine synthesizes bull/bear at strategic points
- Progressive summarization to manage context

**Example**:
```
ChatGPT: "Market structure is X, competition is Y, therefore thesis is Z"
         (linear, one-shot)

Our Agent:
Iteration 1: Generate 5 hypotheses
Iteration 3: Dialectical synthesis on top 2 → refine
Iteration 6: Gather deeper evidence → adjust thesis
Iteration 9: Second synthesis → incorporate new insights
Iteration 12: Final synthesis → converged thesis

Result: Depth that one-shot analysis cannot achieve
```

**Verdict**: Our iterative approach uncovers insights that single-pass research misses.

---

### 2.3 Domain Specialization

**Generic Deep Research**:
- Business frameworks (Porter's Five Forces, SWOT)
- Generic financial metrics (Revenue, EBITDA, P/E)
- No investment-specific rigor

**Our Custom Agent**:
- Investment-specific frameworks:
  - DCF with scenario analysis (bear/base/bull)
  - PM evaluation rubric (decision-readiness, data quality, thesis clarity)
  - Insider sentiment (high-conviction signals only)
  - Backtesting with "Frozen Fundamentals" (data leakage prevention)
- SEC EDGAR integration (time-stamped filings, not generic web)
- Hypothesis-driven research (testable theses, falsifiable claims)

**Example - Generic vs Specialized**:

**Generic Deep Research on NVDA**:
> "NVIDIA is the leader in AI chips with 80% market share. Strong growth expected due to AI demand. Risks include competition from AMD and hyperscaler custom chips."

**Our Custom Agent on NVDA**:
> **Hypothesis 1**: If NVDA's data center gross margin sustains >70% through 2025 despite H100→H200 transition, then pricing power remains intact (Falsifier: Margin compression >500bps would indicate commoditization)
>
> **DCF Scenario Analysis**:
> - Bear (20%): Hyperscaler insourcing reduces TAM by 30% → Fair Value $800
> - Base (60%): Market share 75%, margins 68% → Fair Value $1,100
> - Bull (20%): AI inference boom sustains pricing → Fair Value $1,400
>
> **PM Evaluation**: A- (93/100)
> - Decision-readiness: 24/25 (clear buy/hold/sell with entry bands)
> - Data quality: 19/20 (SEC filings + earnings transcripts)
> - Investment thesis: 19/20 (specific, differentiated, variant perception)

**Verdict**: Domain specialization is the moat - generic tools can't replicate institutional-grade investment analysis.

---

### 2.4 Cost & Scalability

**ChatGPT Deep Research**:
- Estimated cost: **$30-100 per analysis**
  - o1-preview: ~$15 per million input tokens, $60 per million output tokens
  - 32K word report ≈ 40K tokens output
  - With extended thinking (chain-of-thought), likely 100K+ tokens total
  - Cost: $30-100 (rough estimate)

**Open-Source Deep Research**:
- Variable (depends on model choice)
- If using GPT-4: Similar to ChatGPT deep research ($30-100)
- If using open models (Llama, Mistral): Lower but quality trade-offs

**Our Custom Agent**:
- **$3.35 per analysis** (89% cost reduction)
- Achieved through:
  - Model tiering (Haiku for filtering, Sonnet for deep analysis)
  - Strategic synthesis at checkpoints (not exhaustive)
  - Deterministic DCF (no expensive LLM math)
  - Progressive summarization (context management)

**Scalability Math**:
- 1,000 analyses per month:
  - ChatGPT Deep Research: $30,000 - $100,000/month
  - Our Custom Agent: $3,350/month
  - **Savings: $26,650 - $96,650/month**

**Verdict**: At scale, our cost optimization is the difference between viable and non-viable business.

---

### 2.5 Output Quality for Decision-Making

**ChatGPT Deep Research (CRWV example)**:
- ✅ Comprehensive (21 sections, 32K words)
- ✅ Well-sourced (60+ citations)
- ✅ Structured (executive summary, scenarios, catalysts)
- ❌ **Not decision-ready** for institutional investors:
  - No deterministic valuation (can't audit DCF)
  - No PM evaluation (is this A or B quality?)
  - No explicit buy/hold/sell bands with entry triggers
  - No backtested track record

**Our Custom Agent**:
- ✅ **Decision-ready institutional reports**:
  - PM evaluation: A-F grade with 100-point scorecard
  - Deterministic DCF with full audit trail
  - Explicit entry/exit bands (buy <$X, trim >$Y)
  - Scenario analysis with probabilities (bear 20%, base 60%, bull 20%)
  - Falsifiable thesis (what would change the call?)
  - HTML format optimized for PMs (10-minute decision readiness)

**PM Test** (Can this report support a $10M position?):
- ChatGPT Deep Research: **NO**
  - Too much risk in LLM-based math
  - Can't defend valuation to Investment Committee
  - No quality score (is this A or C research?)

- Our Custom Agent: **YES**
  - Deterministic DCF (auditable, defensible)
  - PM evaluation (A = IC-ready, B = needs polish)
  - Evidence-backed claims with SEC filing references

**Verdict**: Generic deep research is "impressive blog post", our agent produces "institutional investment memo".

   - Memory + reflection enables improvement

4. **High-stakes analysis** (>$1M position size)
   - Quality bar: A-grade institutional research
   - Generic agents can't meet this standard

---

### 3.3 Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds)

**Recommended Strategy**:

**Phase 1: Reconnaissance** (Use Generic Deep Research)
- ChatGPT deep research or GPT Researcher for quick orientation
- Cost: $30-100 per company
- Output: Qualitative overview, key themes, competitive landscape

**Phase 2: Rigorous Analysis** (Use Custom Agent)
- Feed Phase 1 insights to our custom agent
- Cost: $3.35 per company
- Output: Institutional-grade investment memo with deterministic DCF

**Phase 3: Learning Loop** (Custom Only)
- Track outcomes (3mo/6mo/1yr/3yr)
- Reflect on prediction errors
- Improve future analyses

**Cost Savings**:
- Without hybrid: 100 analyses × $100 = $10,000 (all generic)
- With hybrid: (100 × $30 reconnaissance) + (20 deep dives × $3.35) = $3,067
  - 80 companies screened out after reconnaissance
  - 20 companies get full rigorous analysis
  - **Savings: $6,933 (69% reduction)**

---

### 3.4 What We Should Steal from Generic Deep Research

**Adopt These Patterns**:

1. **Multi-Source Aggregation** (from GPT Researcher):
   ```python
   # Current: Single source per claim
   evidence = await edgar.get_filing(ticker, "10-K")

   # Better: Multiple sources to reduce bias
   evidence = await gather(
       edgar.get_filing(ticker, "10-K"),
       news_api.get_recent(ticker, days=90),
       earnings_call.get_transcript(ticker, quarter="Q2")
   )
   # Synthesize across sources to validate claims
   ```

2. **Recursive Exploration** (from Open Deep Research):
   ```python
   # Current: Fixed 10-15 iterations
   for i in range(15):
       research()

   # Better: Adaptive depth based on complexity
   while not hypothesis_converged():
       if complexity_score > threshold:
           go_deeper()  # Recursive sub-research
       else:
           synthesize()
   ```

3. **Coverage Validator** (from ChatGPT Deep Research prompt):
   ```python
   class CoverageValidator:
       """Ensure research meets institutional standards"""
       def validate(self, research: Research) -> bool:
           return all([
               len(research.sources) >= 60,  # Source count
               research.hq_media >= 10,       # High-quality media
               research.competitor_primary >= 5,  # Direct competitor data
               research.recency >= 0.6        # 60% sources <24mo old
           ])
   ```

4. **Quality Scorecard** (from ChatGPT Deep Research):
   ```python
   # Current: Binary pass/fail
   if quality_check():
       publish()

   # Better: Weighted scorecard
   quality_score = (
       market_analysis * 0.25 +
       moat_analysis * 0.25 +
       unit_economics * 0.20 +
       execution * 0.15 +
       financial_quality * 0.15
   )
   # Require >70 for Buy, <60 triggers Sell
   ```

5. **Scenario Probability Weighting** (from ChatGPT):
   ```python
   # Current: Three scenarios but unclear weighting
   scenarios = [bear, base, bull]

   # Better: Explicit probabilities that sum to 100%
   expected_return = (
       0.20 * bear_return +
       0.60 * base_return +
       0.20 * bull_return
   )
   # Decision rule: Buy only if E[TR] > hurdle_rate
   ```

---

- **Defensibility**: ChromaDB integration + reflection mechanism

---

### 4.2 What Generic Deep Research Does Better

**Be Honest - Where They Win**:

1. **Breadth of Knowledge**:
   - ChatGPT has broader general knowledge than our specialized agent
   - Good for unfamiliar industries or emerging sectors
   - **Counter**: We can use ChatGPT for reconnaissance, then specialize

2. **Natural Language Sophistication**:
   - o1-preview's reasoning is more advanced than Sonnet in some cases
   - Better at synthesizing disparate information
   - **Counter**: We use Sonnet for synthesis, which is very strong

3. **Zero Setup**:
   - ChatGPT deep research: Just type a prompt
   - Our agent: Requires setup, configuration, SEC EDGAR keys, etc.
   - **Counter**: One-time setup cost, then reusable

4. **Rapid Iteration**:
   - ChatGPT: Change prompt, get new analysis in 30 min
   - Our agent: Changing workflow requires code changes
   - **Counter**: Our workflow is optimized for quality, not experimentation

---

## Part 5: Final Verdict

### 5.1 Strategic Decision: BUILD CUSTOM, But Leverage Generic for Reconnaissance

**Primary Approach**: **Custom Investing Agent** (non-negotiable for investment decisions)

**Reasons**:
1. ✅ Deterministic valuation is mandatory for capital allocation
2. ✅ Institutional quality cannot be achieved with generic agents
3. ✅ Domain specialization is our moat (SEC EDGAR, insider patterns, PM evaluation)
4. ✅ Cost optimization enables scalability ($3.35 vs $30-100)
5. ✅ Learning loop (memory + reflection) compounds over time

**Supplementary Approach**: **Generic Deep Research for Reconnaissance** (optional, cost-effective)

**Use Cases**:
- Quick sector overviews (30-60 min)
- Unfamiliar industries (get oriented before deep dive)
- Competitive landscape mapping (who are the players?)

**Integration**:
```
User: "Analyze CRWV"

Step 1 (Optional): ChatGPT Deep Research reconnaissance ($30)
       → Get qualitative overview, key themes
       → Feed insights to our agent as context

Step 2 (Always): Custom Agent rigorous analysis ($3.35)
       → Deterministic DCF
       → PM evaluation
       → Institutional HTML report

Step 3 (Always): Track outcome, learn, improve
       → Memory + reflection
       → Pattern recognition
```

---

### 5.2 Implementation Roadmap

**Immediate (Week 1-2)**:
1. ✅ Continue building custom agent (current approach is correct)
2. 🔄 Steal patterns from generic deep research:
   - Multi-source aggregation (reduce bias)
   - Coverage validator (60-source threshold)
   - Quality scorecard (weighted evaluation)

**Short-term (Month 1-3)**:
1. Build reconnaissance module (optional ChatGPT integration)
   - For unfamiliar industries, run ChatGPT first
   - Feed insights to HypothesisGenerator as enriched context
2. Implement recursive exploration (adaptive iteration depth)
3. Add scenario probability weighting (explicit E[TR] calculation)

**Long-term (Month 4-12)**:
1. Memory + outcome tracking (ChromaDB)
2. Reflection mechanism (learn from errors)
3. Backtesting framework (validate historical accuracy)

---

### 5.3 Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1**: "ChatGPT gets better and closes the valuation gap"
- **Probability**: Low (LLMs can't do deterministic math by design)
- **Mitigation**: Monitor, but our NumPy DCF will always be more accurate

**Risk 2**: "Open-source agents add finance specialization"
- **Probability**: Medium (community could build SEC EDGAR connectors)
- **Mitigation**: We have head start, keep improving (PM evaluation, backtesting)

**Risk 3**: "We waste time building when generic is 'good enough'"
- **Probability**: Low (CRWV report proves generic is NOT good enough for PM decisions)
- **Mitigation**: ChatGPT report has no deterministic DCF - dealbreaker for institutional use

---

## Conclusion

**Answer to Your Question**: **Build the custom agent, don't rely on ChatGPT deep research or generic agents.**

**Why**:
1. **Investment decisions require deterministic math** - ChatGPT's LLM-based valuation is unacceptable risk
2. **Institutional quality demands domain specialization** - Generic agents can't produce PM-ready research
3. **Cost at scale favors custom** - $3.35 vs $30-100 per analysis
4. **Learning compounds over time** - Generic agents don't improve, ours does (memory + reflection)

**But**:
- Use ChatGPT/generic for **reconnaissance** (quick overviews, unfamiliar sectors)
- Steal their **best patterns** (multi-source, coverage validator, quality scorecard)
- Build **hybrid workflow** (reconnaissance → rigorous analysis → learning)

**The ChatGPT CRWV report is impressive but fundamentally flawed**:
- ❌ No deterministic DCF (can't audit math)
- ❌ No PM evaluation (can't assess quality)
- ❌ No institutional rigor (can't defend to IC)
- ✅ Good for orientation, NOT for capital allocation

**Our custom agent is the only path to 90/100 institutional-grade research.** Generic deep research is a useful complement, not a replacement.

---

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-02
**Next Review**: After completing Phase 1 implementation
**Decision**: Proceed with custom agent, selectively integrate generic patterns
