## Test Coverage

### Part 1: Legacy Mathematical Property Tests ✅

These tests verify fundamental mathematical properties and were ported from the battle-tested production codebase.

#### 1. PV Bridge Test (`test_pv_bridge_exact`)
**Formula**: `PV_explicit + PV_terminal = PV_oper_assets`

**Result**: ✅ PASS
**Precision**: < 1e-8 (essentially perfect)

```
PV Explicit:  $566.15
PV Terminal:  $4,090.00
PV Operating: $4,656.15  ✓ Exact match
```

**What This Verifies**: The accounting identity holds - no value is lost or created in the bridge calculation.

---

#### 2. Midyear Uplift Test (`test_midyear_uplift_band`)
**Formula**: `df_midyear = df_endyear * sqrt(1 + r)`

**Expected**: Midyear discounting should increase PV by 1.5-3.5%
**Result**: ✅ PASS - 2.0% uplift (within band)

**What This Verifies**: The midyear adjustment formula is correctly applied, producing values consistent with financial theory.

---

#### 3. Gradient Signs Test (`test_gradient_signs`)
**Directional Checks**:
- Higher operating margin → Higher value ✅
- Higher WACC → Lower value ✅

**Results**:
- +1% margin → +1.6% value increase ✓
- +1% WACC → -34.4% value decrease ✓

**What This Verifies**: Value moves in economically sensible directions with respect to key inputs.

---

#### 4. Terminal Constraint Test (`test_terminal_constraint_raises`)
**Constraint**: `g_terminal < WACC_terminal - 50bps`

**Result**: ✅ PASS - Correctly raises `ValueError` when constraint violated

**What This Verifies**: The Gordon Growth Model constraint is enforced, preventing mathematically invalid terminal values.

### Part 2: Hand-Calculated Reference Values ✅

These tests verify every step of the DCF calculation against manual calculations.

- Growth: 10%, 5%, 0%
- Margin: 20%
- Tax: 25%
- WACC: 10%
- Terminal: g=2%, m=20%

**Manual Calculation**:

| Year | Revenue | EBIT | NOPAT | Reinvest | FCFF | Discount Factor | PV |
|------|---------|------|-------|----------|------|----------------|-----|
| 1 | $110.00 | $22.00 | $16.50 | $5.00 | $11.50 | 0.9091 | $10.45 |
| 2 | $115.50 | $23.10 | $17.33 | $2.75 | $14.58 | 0.8264 | $12.05 |
| 3 | $115.50 | $23.10 | $17.33 | $0.00 | $17.33 | 0.7513 | $13.02 |

**Terminal Calculation**:
- Revenue T+1: $117.81
- FCFF T+1: $16.52
- TV: $16.52 / (0.10 - 0.02) = $206.46
- PV Terminal: $206.46 * 0.7513 = $155.11

**Expected vs Actual**:
- PV Explicit: $35.52 ✅ MATCH
- PV Terminal: $155.11 ✅ MATCH
- PV Operating: $190.63 ✅ MATCH

**Result**: ✅ PASS - Every intermediate step verified

**What This Verifies**: The complete DCF calculation is correct from revenue projection through to final PV.

#### 6. Zero Growth Perpetuity (`test_zero_growth_perpetuity`)

**Setup**:
- Revenue: $100 (constant)
- Margin: 20%
- Tax: 25%
- Growth: 0%

**Formula**: `Value = FCFF / WACC` (perpetuity)

**Expected**:
- EBIT: $20
- NOPAT: $15
- Reinvestment: $0 (no growth)
- FCFF: $15 (constant)
- All 5 years should produce exactly $15 FCFF

**Result**: ✅ PASS - All FCFFs = $15.00

**What This Verifies**: Zero-growth case (no reinvestment) works correctly.

---

#### 7. Negative Net Debt Test (`test_negative_net_debt`)

**Formula**: `Equity = PV_ops - Net_Debt + Cash_nonop`

**Test**:
- Case A: Net Debt = $10
- Case B: Net Debt = -$10 (net cash)
- Difference should be exactly $20

**Result**: ✅ PASS - $20.00 difference

**What This Verifies**: Debt/cash adjustments are applied correctly in the equity bridge.

---

### Part 3: Formula & Edge Case Verification ✅

These tests verify specific formulas and edge cases.

#### 8. Discount Factor Formula (`test_discount_factor_formula`)

**Formula**: `DF_t = 1 / prod(1 + r_i)` for i=1 to t

**Method**: Calculate discount factors manually using NumPy and compare

**Result**: ✅ PASS - rtol < 1e-10

**What This Verifies**: The compound discounting formula is implemented correctly.

---

#### 9. Midyear Discount Adjustment (`test_midyear_discount_adjustment`)

**Formula**: `DF_midyear = DF_endyear * sqrt(1 + r)`

**Method**: Calculate end-year, apply adjustment, compare to midyear calculation

**Result**: ✅ PASS - rtol < 1e-10

**What This Verifies**: The midyear timing adjustment matches the standard formula.

---

#### 10. High Growth / High Reinvestment (`test_high_growth_high_reinvestment`)

**Setup**:
- Growth: 50%, 40%, 30% (very high)
- Sales-to-Capital: 1.5 (low capital efficiency)

**Expected**: Negative FCFF in early years (reinvestment > NOPAT)

**Result**: ✅ PASS - Year 1 FCFF = -$10.83 (negative)

**What This Verifies**: The model correctly handles negative cash flows when reinvestment exceeds operating profit.
