Option A: Fallback Strategy (RECOMMENDED)
------------------------------------------
Since WebSearch from nested query() is blocked, we should:

1. Try web search first (will likely fail with permissions)
2. On permission error, fall back to enriched SEC filing analysis:
   - Parse 10-K MD&A sections (already implemented)
   - Parse Risk Factors
   - Parse quarterly 10-Qs for recent trends
   - Extract segment-level revenue data

This gives us 15-20 evidence items per hypothesis from SEC data alone,
which may be sufficient to achieve confidence >0.2 threshold.

Option B: Document as Known Limitation
---------------------------------------
Add to docs that web research requires manual approval when running
as a standalone agent. Works fine in interactive Claude Code use.

Option C: Pre-fetch Strategy
------------------------------
Have the orchestrator (running in parent context) do web searches
BEFORE creating the research sub-agent, then pass results as static sources.

Which approach should we take?

Given the constraints, I recommend **Option A: Fallback Strategy**.

This provides the best user experience:
- Attempts web research (may work in some deployment contexts)
- Gracefully falls back to SEC data when blocked
- Still generates 15+ evidence items per hypothesis
- No manual intervention required

Implementation:
1. Wrap query() calls in try/except
2. Catch permission errors
3. Log fallback to SEC-only mode
4. Continue with enriched SEC parsing

This maintains quality while handling the permission limitation gracefully.
